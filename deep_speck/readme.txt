If you want to obtain neural distinguishers proposed by Gohr, 
run  train_distinguisher.py

If you want to obtain neural distinguishers trained over ciphertext groups, 
run  train_distinguisher_mc.py

****************************************

If you want to train neural distinguishers under two setting (with a joint key, without a joint key) over the same data,
run train_distinguisher_jk_rk.py

****************************************

If you want to test whether accuracy can be improved by directly feeding multiple ciphertext pairs into the neural network proposed by Gohr,
run train_distinguisher_mc_gohr.py
